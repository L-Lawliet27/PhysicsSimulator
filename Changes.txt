Status Bar
===========
- Took out the Body Status onAdvance()


Main/BodiesTableModel
=====================
- Defined an initial length to rowData so it returns "", thus not adding -i doesn't throw an exception

- Eliminated the private List of Bodies, so I just pass it locally to updateTable()

- Added private int rowCount with default value 1, and private method updateRowCount() that is called when
  table resets, is on register, or when a body is added


Viewer
=======
- Added 4 to the starting points of the vectors to put them in the center of the body
